<p><strong>Fasting</strong>. For most people, the longest fast they ever have is the one between going to sleep and waking up the next day. And some don't even make that far... including this guy right here. However, evidence reveals we need to take a serious look at this ancient practice of self loathing† and obligatory penitence for last night's batch of chocolate chip cookies. </p>

<!-- /wp:verse -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, what happens when you push your body beyond it's normal fast window? According to science, quite a lot. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We've known for a while now that restricting your caloric intake increases life expectancy, and we also know why. Low calorie diets slow the metabolic rate and reduce the introduction of free radicals into the body. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ok... So what does that even mean?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It means eating less gives your cells some down time to relax, and also, it means fewer atoms/molecules are being destroyed by free radicals ripping through your body.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your body is made of cells (hopefully this part isn't surprising?). Each cell is powered by ATP (Adenosine triphosphate). Of course... we don't eat ATP so how do cells get it? After food is digested into its most basic components (proteins, fats, sugar) it is then transported through the super highway of our bloodstream where it gets to cells. Each cell contains 10s to 1000s of mitochondria which take glucose (as a primary component), "burn" it in oxygen, and chemically convert it to ATP in a reaction channel that actually looks like a tiny intestine.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-2 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="http://whatthehealth.today/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mitochodrion.png" alt="" data-id="267" class="wp-image-267"/></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="http://whatthehealth.today/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/1-studyshowsmi.jpg" alt="" data-id="272" data-link="http://whatthehealth.today/?attachment_id=272" class="wp-image-272"/></figure></li></ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The process of converting oxygen and sugar to energy is slightly similar to the explosion in a gas powered engine: each reaction costs the cell. So, in laymen's terms, every time a cell receives energy from a mitochondrion, there's one less explosion that mitochondrion can produce. This process also produces ionized free radicals, some of which are helpful (needed to help white blood cells defeat disease for example), others are harmful (causing damage to otherwise healthy cells) and this is the greater concern. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In short, if free radicals are roaming terrorists in your blood stream heat seeking any electrons they can find, antioxidants are the heroes who take the hit for the team and pair up with free radicals putting them into a blissful state of peace. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here's how scientists explain just one small part of that:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Oxidative phosphorylation occurring in mitochondria is a nonenzymatic process which results in the production of ROS (reactive oxygen species) and RNS (reactive nitrogen species)." </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And here's how scientists order pizza: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I'd like a saccharomyces cerevisiae raised gluten chain crust covered with blended solanum lycopersicum, origanum vulgare, and sodium chloride, topped with varied curdled and aged bovine growth serums species, please. Oh... and this order is for delivery. I don't go outside. By the way - do you have any pickled capsicum annuum?"</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes - exactly like that. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back to immortality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Researchers from the University of Southern California published findings from their research of the cellular impact of fasting, and folks - it's pretty surprising.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>"Periods of no food for two to four days at a time over the course of six months kill older and damaged immune cells and generate new ones." </p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Furthermore, when mice were studied with various diet regimens, it was found that mice who ate less food fewer times a day lived longer than both groups of mice that 1) could eat as often as they wanted and 2) ate a regularly scheduled diet. Science proves that eating smaller helpings less often increases life span - and that is actual scientific fact. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do you understand the implications here? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It literally means you can extend your life expectancy, regenerate your immune system, increase your tolerance for processing toxins (in particular researchers found that fasting for 3 days before chemotherapy and one day after significantly reduced patients reaction to the treatment's highly toxic effects), and aid with a wide range of immune system issues including autoimmune disorders, all by simply starving yourself for just a few days or even large portions of every single day. </p>

<h2>You ever heard of Breatharians? </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Breatharianism is interesting.  The claims by one man in particular who says he's not eaten or drank any water for 70 years since he was 8.  When he was blessed by a goddess. I know, I know - but keep reading.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Prahlad Jani claims to be able to eat prana from the sun. Of course we could never accept such claims at face value so he was put under strict medical observation for 10 days. During this time, he never ate, drank, nor did he defecate or urinate. No medical determination could be reached - according to science it is an impossible feat, but he did it.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are some things science cannot yet explain, but we are definitely unlocking secrets that are difficult to believe. One thing is certain: eating less food is now scientifically proven to extend life span in mice, regenerate the immune system, reduce cellular aging, and I am sure much more we've not yet observed. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As for immortality? I guess we'll have to touch base with Prahlad Jani in another 70 years and we'll have a better answer.</p>

<p>Until next time,<br>GP</p>

<p>† Bet you thought I forgot about that reference. Nope - it seems it's not loathing but an expression of highest self love. </p>
