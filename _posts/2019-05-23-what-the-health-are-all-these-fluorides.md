<p><strong>Water fluoridation</strong>. Love it or hate it, it's been with us for over 70 years now starting January 25, 1945 in Beer City, USA - Grand Rapids, Michigan. They were the first in the world to start the program. Now, there's a lot of debate over this topic and for good reason. However, one thing I often see on social media is that many people, including professional dentists, do not understand what fluoride really is so let's start there and clear some things up!</p>

<p>When people talk about fluoride, we're really talking about the element fluorine. In its elemental state it is a highly reactive and dangerous light yellow-green gas. In fact, it's the most reactive of all the halogen elements - which means it does exciting things with just about everything. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="here's some steel wool bursting into flames on contact with F gas (opens in a new tab)" href="https://youtu.be/V1FsO5zaf6M" target="_blank">Here's some steel wool bursting into flames on contact with fluorine (F) gas</a>. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It becomes fluoride once it combines with a metallic element like sodium or calcium which creates fluoride salts (not the kind you eat though!)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"regular"} -->
<p class="has-regular-font-size">Fortunately, fluorine gas doesn't really exist as a gas anywhere outside of a lab. So, let's just quickly look at the ones we deal with regularly:</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"regular"} -->
<p class="has-regular-font-size">When people say "<em>fluoride occurs naturally in ground water!</em>" they are usually talking about calcium fluoride (even if they aren't aware of it). It's almost insoluble in pure distilled water (meaning calcium fluoride doesn't change into anything else in water, but does when combined with acids). Calcium fluoride is the least bioreactive of the compounds so it's the safest for biological life. However, there are some areas of the world where it can be a concern (many parts of Asia struggle with overexposure to fluoride). It's only dangerous when you mix it with a strong acid, like sulfuric acid where it creates hydrofluoric acid. This is important since our stomachs contain hydrochloric acid - a strong acid.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Personally, I think calcium fluoride is beautiful in its mineral form. Someone really needs to make lamps out of these - it would look awesome near our Himalayan sea salt lamp! Don't you think??  </p>

<p class="has-regular-font-size">Sodium fluoride is what they add to toothpaste, mouthwash, dental pastes and washes, and also - surprisingly -  filtered baby drinking water. I hope someone will explain that one to me because they have no teeth yet... right? </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sodium fluoride is quite toxic and highly soluble in water so it breaks into ionic form. That means the F+ part of the compound will break away which can later combine with other compounds or elements. Unfortunately, it has numerous well known negative impacts on our biology (it's really a wonder why dentists are still using it, but that is its own topic for a future article). You cannot handle it with your hands - you'll need proper safety equipment and ventilation: overexposure is fatal. Calcium fluoride and sodium fluoride are not even remotely the same compounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sodium fluoride can occur naturally in mineral form (called villiaumite for those interested), but it is not as common as calcium fluoride. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These two are kissin cousins so I cover them together. Hexafluorosilicic acid is the most common way they claim to add fluoride to municipal water supplies across the USA. It is usually added directly in aqueous (water) solution. These compounds are both fluorosilicates - which are very different than fluorides. A big reason for this is that the F (fluorine) and Si (silicon) atoms don't usually dissolve. So, when they enter your body, you aren't getting just fluoride, but fluorosilicate. And remember that silica crystalizes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because fluorosilicic acid leeches copper out of pipes, they combine it with sodium hydroxide (lye) which produces the salt called sodium hexafluorosilicate. This protects the pipes, but not our bodies. At a normal water pH of 7, about 97% of the fluorine is absorbed by the body. BUT, if you drop the pH to 6 - just slightly more acidic - suddenly only 27% F is absorbed and you are ingesting more complex compounds of fluorosilicates. Then, when combined with a strong acid - like the hydrochloric acid of your stomach - hardly any F+ ions exist at all which means even if it does help your teeth, very little is bioavailable.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These chemicals are only commonly found because both the fertilizer and aluminum industries create them as significant byproducts of their chemical production processes (think Alcoa, Bayer, DuPont, etc). Take note that they combine easily with aluminum. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These compounds are highly toxic and dangerous chemicals. From <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="PubChem (opens in a new tab)" href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Sodium_hexafluorosilicate" target="_blank">PubChem</a>:</p>

<p>So... how much rat poison is good for our teeth? No matter how diluted it is, it's probably not the best idea to be bathing in it, swimming in it, or drinking it. So honestly I avoid it as much as possible. </p>

<p>There you have it! A very brief introduction to the fluorides we interact with regularly. I wanted to make this short and sweet so we can be on the same page. Water fluoridation is a massive topic, and I'll cover more articles on this in the future. If there is anything in particular you want to know about this, please let me know! But, I'll likely do a series on fluoride covering how to filter it from water to some health impacts that you should know. Stay tuned and I'll wrote more soon.</p>
