<p><strong>Water fluoridation</strong>. Love it or hate it, they started adding fluoride to our public water over 70 years ago: January 25, 1945 in "Beer City", USA - Grand Rapids, Michigan - first in the world! From the beginning there's been lots of debate over this practice and for good reason. However, one thing I often see on social media is that many people, including professional dentists, do not understand what fluoride is so let's start there and clear some things up!</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When people talk about fluoride, we're really talking about the halogen gas fluorine. In its elemental state it is a highly reactive and dangerous light yellow-green gas. It's the most reactive of all the halogen gases - which means it does exciting things with just about everything. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="here's some steel wool bursting into flames on contact with F gas (opens in a new tab)" href="https://youtu.be/V1FsO5zaf6M" target="_blank">Here's some steel wool bursting into flames just because fluorine gas touched it</a>. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fluorine gas becomes fluoride when combined with a metallic element like sodium or calcium. This creates fluoride salts (not the kind you eat though!). There are many different fluoride salts so let's just look at the ones we deal with regularly:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>calcium fluoride (natural)</li><li>sodium fluoride (dentist)</li><li>fluorosilicic acid (water)</li><li>sodium fluorosilicate (water)</li></ul>

<p class="has-regular-font-size">Calcium fluoride is what is found naturally on Earth. When people say "<em>fluoride occurs naturally in ground water!</em>" they are usually talking about calcium fluoride (even if they aren't aware of it). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's almost insoluble in pure distilled water (it won't dissolve). Calcium fluoride is the least bioreactive of the compounds so it's the safest for living organisms. However, there are some areas of the world where it can be a concern (many parts of Asia struggle with overexposure to fluoride). It's dangerous when you mix it with a strong acid, like sulfuric acid where it creates hydrofluoric acid. This is important since our stomachs contain hydrochloric acid - a strong acid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think calcium fluoride is beautiful in its mineral form. Someone should sell fluorite lamps - it would look awesome with a Himalayan sea salt lamp. Don't you think??  </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"regular"} -->
<p class="has-regular-font-size">Sodium fluoride is what Dentists use. It's added to toothpaste, mouthwash, dental pastes and washes, and also - surprisingly -  filtered water for babies. I hope someone will explain that one to me because they have no teeth yet... right? </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sodium fluoride is quite toxic and highly soluble in water so it breaks into ionic form. That means the F+ part of the compound will break away which can later combine with other compounds or elements. Unfortunately, it has numerous known negative impacts on our biology (it's really a wonder why dentists are still using it). You cannot handle it with your hands - you'll need proper safety equipment and ventilation: overexposure can be fatal. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you can see - calcium fluoride and sodium fluoride are not even remotely the same compounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sodium fluoride can occur naturally in mineral form (called villiaumite for those interested), but it is not as common as calcium fluoride. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These two are kissin' cousins so I cover them together. They're what are most often added to your water.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hexafluorosilicic acid is the most common way fluoride is added to municipal water supplies across the USA. It is usually added directly in aqueous (water) solution. Technically, this isn't really even fluoride. They are fluorosilicates - which are very different. A big reason for this is that the F (fluorine) and Si (silicon) in fluorosilicate doesn't easily dissolve. When it enters your body, you aren't getting just fluoride, but fluorosilicate. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because fluorosilicic acid leeches copper out of pipes, they combine it with sodium hydroxide (lye) which produces the salt called sodium hexafluorosilicate. This protects the pipes, but not necessarily our bodies. At a normal water pH of 7, about 97% of the fluorine is absorbed by the body. BUT, if you drop the pH to 6 - just slightly more acidic - suddenly only 27% F is absorbed and you are ingesting more complex compounds of fluorosilicates. Then, when combined with a strong acid - like the hydrochloric acid of your stomach - hardly any F+ ions exist at all which means even if it does help your teeth, very little is bioavailable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These chemicals are only commonly used because both the fertilizer and aluminum industries create them as significant byproducts of their chemical production processes (think Alcoa, Bayer, DuPont, etc). Take note that they combine easily with aluminum. This is important because aluminum is found in numerous products from deodorant to vaccines.</p>

<p>So... how much rat poison is good for our teeth? No matter how diluted it is, it's probably not the best idea to be bathing in it, swimming in it, or drinking it. So honestly I avoid it as much as possible. </p>
